# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from the data using visual and statistical techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset (Kaggle)
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` – Summary report with insights and visuals
- `Titanic_EDA_Visuals.png` – Combined chart image

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Key Insights

- More males than females were aboard.
- Females had a much higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers survived more than third-class.
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
- Fare paid and class were positively correlated with survival.

## 🧠 What is EDA?

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It helps understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the data using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## 💡 How to Use

1. Open the notebook `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to see the analysis and plots.
3. Check `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` for a clean summary.
